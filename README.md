Hi! Welcome to my PhD Application Guide. I hope you find something useful here. If you have suggestions for improvements or sections that should be added, feel free to email me at phd.unknown7@gmail.com

# About Me and This Guide
While I'd prefer to try to keep myself anonymous, I do want to at least give you some information about who you might be taking advice from on such an important process.
I was a first-generation undergrad from a very small, rural area of Central Appalachia. I graduated from The Ohio State University in 2019 with majors in Behavioral Neuroscience and Psychology. During undergrad I worked in a psychology lab as a research assistant for two and a half years. I also completed and successfully defended an undergradute research thesis. I was really fortunate to publish this work as a first-author in a journal. I completely fell in love with research as a result of these experiences. After graduating, I took a position as a research assistant in a neuroscience lab an R1 University in another state. There, I worked on studies related to Alzheimer's, sleep, and movement disorders. I published as a part of this lab as well. After two years in that role, I began working in the clinical trials industry in a supervisory role. I stayed in this position for 2 years before resigning in May 2023 to take time off before starting my PhD program. I'll be starting my Psychological Science PhD this fall at a school in the University of California system.

I faced significant challanges in my PhD journey as a first-generation student. You'll find more information about what these were and how I addressed them as you read through these sections. I am also the first person in my entire extended family to ever pursue a PhD. I created this guide in the hopes that people could find useful information that might help them struggle a bit less than I did.

# Planning Your Application: A Timeline
Advanced planning and preparation are key to avoiding last-minute scrambling to get your materials finished and submitted on time. The following is a sample timeline that will help ensure you're on track for late November/early December PhD application deadlines. 

## Spring
The Spring before your deadline is the time to start dipping your toe into the application process by doing the following:

### 1. Begin reading sample statements of purpose and personal statements
A simple google search will give you plenty of statement of purpose (SOP) and personal statements to start skimming through. At this stage, start taking note of what you like and dislike about the statements you read. Pay attention to the structure of the statements and start thinking about creating a general outline for your own. 

### 2. Start reading research articles in your intended area of study
One of your goals over the next few months is going to be narrowing your research focus so that you have a clear and specific idea of what you want to study in your PhD program. This will be a central point in your statement of purpose and is incredibly useful in identifying potential faculty and programs you can consider applying to. If you have a broad research idea (i.e. interest in the impact of exercise on mental health) start there and cast a wide net for your initial search. The important thing to keep in mind is that you want to work toward taking your interest from a general topic to a specific, testable question. 

### 3. Start making a list of potential faculty and programs
This goes hand-in-hand with the point above. PhD programs are all about research fit with faculty (assuming you are applying to a direct entry program). Programs want to see in your SOP that you have identified 2-3 faculty there that match your interests. For a detailed description of how to choose where to apply, there's a section below.

## Early Summer
This is when you start digging in. Your goal for early summer is to put together a picture of what you want your PhD experience to look like.

### 1. Keep reading example statements and start your own
Writing the SOP and personal statement is one of the most daunting aspects of the application process. These are, arguably, the most important pieces of your application packet and take time to get right. If summer seems too early to start these, I highly suggest doing it anyway. As you continue digging into research articles, your interests will evolve and so will your statements. By now you should have a general idea of how statements are structured and it's time to begin your own. 

### 2. Begin formulating your research question(s)
Having a clear, specific line of research you intend to pursue in your PhD program is crucial to making sure you find the right faculty to work with and making your SOP shine. As a caveat, this may not be as important to programs that are rotational rather than direct entry. 

### 3. Review and refine your program/faculty list
Now that you have a better understanding of what you want to study, head back to your faculty list and revisit whether those people would be a good fit for your interests. Start narrowing down the list depending on the factors that are most important to you. Is it crucial that your potential advisor uses a specific technique? Is it a must that they work with a certain population? Do you only want an advisor who works on a particular model? Questions like these are important to start considering at this stage.

If you still have a lengthy list, don't worry. You will want the extra wiggle room when it comes time to check which of these folks are accepting students. 

### 4. Begin working on your other application materials
There are a few things that almost every PhD application will require other than the SOP and personal statements:

#### 1. CV
If you aren't sure what a CV is supposed to look like or what it should include, a good place to start is looking at the CVs of faculty you've identified. There are also free templates on Word and Google Docs you can utilize. The most common sections included in CVs are: education, publications, research/work experience, presentations, technical/lab skills, and honors/awards.

#### 2. Transcripts
Pay special attention to whether a program accepts unofficial transcripts or if they require official transcripts. Programs most commonly accept unofficial transcripts, but be sure to double check. This should be stated on the page of the program website that talks about required application materials. 

Request your transcripts in early summer. I know this seems premature, but it's the best way to make sure you have them in time for your application deadlines. There are way too many horror stories out there of people not receiving their transcripts in time despite multiple requests. 

#### 3. Letters of Recommendation
Start thinking about who you might ask for a letter of recommendation. If you have time, look through example LORs online to see what these look like.

#### 4. GRE (depending on your field)
More and more programs are doing away with the GRE requirement. Start looking at what the required materials are for programs you've identified to see if they require the GRE. 

## Late Summer
Now you are really heating up on your application journey. By the end of summer, your goal is to know what your PhD focus will be, how you'll get there, and why it's right for you. 

### 1. Finalize your research question(s)
I put this first for a reason. Your research question(s) are central to determining where you will apply and writing your statements. If you're still stuck on this, try branching out to things you may not have originally included in your brainstorming earlier in the summer. 

### 2. Begin reaching out to faculty you are interested in working with
Determining what professors are accepting students for your cycle can be annoyingly difficult. Start by checking the following places:
####  Program websites will sometimes post a list of faculty currently accepting students.
#### Faculty profile pages will sometimes include a note about whether they will be accepting students.
#### Some faculty have websites for their lab which may include a statement about whether they are accepting students.

Make sure you check these places and anywhere else you can think of thoroughly before reaching out to a potential advisor. The last thing you want is to email them asking if they are accepting students only to discover it's been clearly stated on the program home page.  

This is where having some extra faculty/programs on your list can come in handy. The overwhelming odds are that not every potential advisor you identified will be accepting students. 

### 3. Identify at least one program you will definitely be applying to
It isn't a must that you have your absolutely finalized list of programs yet, but it is important that you have at least one. This will help you immensely in completing a first draft of your statements, especially your SOP. Once you have a program and 2-3 faculty in that program identified, you can start answering the big questions in your SOP:
#### Why this program?
#### What faculty do you want to work with?
#### Why do these faculty align with your research question(s)?

### 4. Complete a first full fradt of your SOP and personal statements
Let's face it. If you're anything like me, your first drafts are going to be.....rough. You want to leave yourself plenty of time to edit these, and even be able to take a break from working on them if it's getting overwhelming. These statements are often frustrating and draining to write. If you have a full first draft by the end of summer, you're in great shape to take a week or two away from them. 

Using the one program you know you'll apply to in your first draft will give you a template to work off of for all your other programs. Personally, I did my first draft SOP using my top choice program. This allowed me to make sure it was the program I put the most effort toward in my application. 

### 5. Reach out to your letter of recommendation writers
If you are planning to ask faculty (the ideal scenario) for a letter of recommendation, I highly encourage you to reach out to them by the end of September. Professors are incredibly busy folks, so leaving them plenty of time to write you an LOR will benefit you. This will also leave you enough time to work on a back-up plan in the event someone you ask declines to write a letter for you. 

## October - Early November
You've done all the work to lay a solid foundation for your applications. Now your goal is to begin customizing. 

### 1. Have a finalized list of your programs and faculty
Ideally you will have your programs and 2-3 faculty members of choice at each identified by mid October. This will give you time to start doing a deeper dive on the research these professors are doing and to take a closer look at the programs. 

### 2. Start tailoring your statements for each program
Good statements will make it clear that they have been created for a specific program, especially the SOP. It's completely okay to use the same framework for all of your statements, just make sure it's evident to an admissions committee that you have researched their program. You want to find things about the program/University as a whole that appeal to you.

Looking at the program webpage is an easy place to start. Things you can look for in programs that you can mention in your statements:
#### Does that program have particularly strong resources for graduate students?
#### Do they offer a dual title PhD that you are interested in?
#### Do they offer unique coursework other programs may not?
#### Does the program seem particularly collaborative? 
#### Do they have they option of a unique minor other programs do not have?
#### Does the University have an especially strong Diversity and Inclusion initiative?

Beyond mentioning things about the program/University, you will of course want to include what faculty you are interested in working with and why. 

The allotted word count or length you are given for statements will also vary from program to program. Make sure you are extra careful to take note of the word or page limit for each program. 

### 3. Ensure you have all the additiona materials required by programs
When I was applying, I found it incredibly useful to create a table containing, among other things, a list of all the required materials for each program. This was much easier than constantly going back to a program's website to double check what was needed. 

Make sure you have received your transcripts and GRE scores (if applicable) and have a draft or finalized CV.  

### 4. Keep in touch with your LOR writers
It's frighteningly (though not surprisingly) common for LOR writers to either forget they have agreed to do this or put completing an LOR off until the last minute. Don't panic! Many programs anticipate that applicants will have letters of recommendation submitted after the deadline and allow a grace period for this. Here is my suggested timeline for attempting to prevent a letter being submitted late (assuming you secured an agreement from a writer in late summer):

#### One month before the deadline
Send a short, friendly reminder email. At this point most LOR writers haven't even started working on it, but you want to keep it on their radar. 

#### Two weeks before the deadline
This one is optional. If you're confident your letter writer will come through for you, I think it's safe to skip. Otherwise, another short, friendly reminder email is fine to send. 

#### One week before the deadline
If you skipped the two-week email, go ahead and send a reminder. If you sent the two-week email but did not get a response, go ahead and send a reminder. In this case, it is also not the worst idea to prepare to ask someone to be a back-up writer if you are concerned by a lack of response. If you sent the two-week reminder and got a response, it's probably safe to skip.

#### 2-3 days before the deadline
The (hopefully) final reminder to anyone that has not yet submitted their LOR. 

### 5. Create your account and start your application in the portal
PhD applications require more than you attaching your materials and clicking submit. There are questions about your education, background, etc. that also need to be completed. Go ahead and set up your account and start your application so you can get everything filled out ahead of time.

This is also useful to start in advance because some applications will have extra text boxes where you can include supplemental information about yourself. A few of my applications included unexpected prompts such as "Is there anything not covered in the required materials that you would like the admissions committee to know?" along with a 150-250 word limit text box. This is gold if there's something you needed to address in your statements but did not have room for or couldn't find a way to weave in. Knowing if prompts like these exist in advance will give you time to think of what you may be able to include.

## Mid - Late November
Congratulations, you're in the home stretch! Now your goal is to polish and submit. 

### Finalize your SOP and personal statement
Editing is the name of the game in the last few weeks before application deadlines. Make your finishing touches like rewording, moving sentences around, etc.

Review your statements for the kinds of mistakes that sound silly, but happen quite frequently and make people panic after submission:

#### Did you make sure you did not accidentally use the name of different University or program anywhere in the statement?
#### Did you spell the names of the professors correctly everywhere they are mentioned?
#### Did you make sure you did not accidentally include the name of a professor from a different University anywhere in the statement?
#### Did you make sure the program name matches the appropriate University and vice versa?

### 2. Ensure all your LORs were received
If you followed by suggested timeline above, hopefully you will see all of your letters have bee marked as received in your application portal. If you're concerned someone will not meet the deadline, find a back-up writer and email the program coordinator at each University to inquire about what their grace period for receiving LORs is. 

### 3. Upload all of your materials to the application portal
I suggest doing this at least a week before the application deadline, especially your transcripts. Personally, I had an issue uploading my transcripts for several of my applications and had to reach out to the program for assistance. Luckily, this was about 2 weeks out from the deadline, so there was plenty of time for resolution. 

### 4. Submit!
Breathe a sigh of relief, you did it!
